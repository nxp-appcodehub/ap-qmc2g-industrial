 * @brief Defines the authenticated watchdog timer (AWDG).
 *
 * The authenticated watchdog timer is an extension of the LWDGU module. An authenticated
 * watchdog only performs a deferral if a fresh and valid signed ticket is provided.
 *
 * This module relies on the mbedtls library and requires at least AWDG_MBEDTLS_HEAP_MIN_STATIC_BUFFER_SIZE
 * bytes of memory. The user must set up mbedtls to have at least this heap memory available!
 *
 * The AWDG has to be initialized dynamically with the AWDG_Init() function, which also
 * starts the watchdog. A nonce for ticket creation can be obtained by calling the
 * AWDG_GetNonce() function. A signed ticket can be given to and verified by the AWDG
 * using the AWDG_ValidateTicket() function (takes up to 15016ms on an RT1176 CM4).
 * After a successful verification attempt, the user can defer the watchdog by executing
 * the AWDG_DeferWatchdog() function.
 *
 * The AWDG_Tick() and AWDG_GetRemainingTicks() functions can be called from interrupts.
 * Other functions should not be called from interrupts!
 * Check the API descriptions of the individual functions for detailed information
 * about the concurrency assumptions.
 *
 * The ticket signature algorithm is fixed to ECDSA with a 512-bit curve. The
 * signature and key must be in the ASN.1 DER format defined in www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf
 * Appendix C. The ticket is a binary blob with the following content:
 * 
 *  ```text
 *  | new timeout (u32 LE) | ASN.1 DER 512-bit ECDSA signature |
 *   0                    3 4                               140 (max)
 *  ```
 * 
 * The external requirements for the QMC 2G project are:
 *  - The AWDG should be ticked every millisecond allowing timeout periods
 *    up to (2^32 - 2) / 1000 / 3600 / 24 ~ 49 days.
 *  - After the AWDG expires, the system has to be notified about the upcoming reset (logging), 
 *    and the reset cause has to be stored in the SNVS (secure non-volatile storage). 
 *    The previous reset cause should be available after a reboot (as the CM7 application 
 *    needs this information).
 *  - The AWDG's tick value and state (running / not running) should periodically be stored
 *    in the SNVS to restore the state after a reset. The backup tick value is calculated by right-shifting 
 *    the current tick value by 16 (rounding up; value approximately represents minutes). If the AWDG has not expired,
 *    the backup state value is 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0. If the AWDG did expire, the state value of 0
 *    and the reset cause are directly written into the SNVS to ensure these values are backed up before
 *    the system reset. The backup values are used during initialization to restore the watchdog's state 
 *    (if it was running). The 16-bit shifted tick value is halved before the initialization to ensure the 
 *    AWDG expires in case of a reboot loop. Before an initialization, the two possible saved states are:  
 *    Timer was not running at all (fresh init), or timer was running (resume with values from SNVS).
 *    The SNVS values are reset to zero at a cold boot. Hence, the backup format should be designed so that
 *    initial zero values are logically correct (e.g., an isRunning flag is ok).
 *  - The before-mentioned SNVS must be isolated from the CM7 after the initial
 *    bootloader handed over control and only accessible by the CM4 afterward.
 *  - If the AWDG should expire during the grace period of a functional watchdog unit,
 *    the reset cause shall be overwritten to reflect that the AWDG expired. This
 *    behavior is relevant for security as the reset cause triggers a boot into recovery mode. 
 *    However, in the worst case, the log entry describing the AWDG expired will not appear in the log file. 
 *    Further, if a functional watchdog unit expires during the grace period of the AWDG,
 *    the reset cause should not be overwritten by the functional watchdog unit!
 *  - If the AWDG initialization fails, the caller has to ensure that the board reboots
 *    into recovery mode.
 *  - The QMC 2G project needs possible timeout times of >= 7 days, which should be asserted wherever
 *    the AWDG is configured. This assertion can not be done in this module as it would influence 
 *    testability.
 *  - The initial seed (384 bit of min-entropy) for initializing the used CTR_DRBG implementation from mbedtls comes 
 *    from the DRBG in CAAM and is passed to the CM4 via the bootloader (CAAM usage is reserved to the CM7).  
 *    However, as stated below reseeding is disabled as no access to an entropy source is possible afterwards.
 * 
 * Limitations:
 *  - The CM4 does not have access to the secure element or other entropy providers. Hence, the used software
 *    DRBG only receives entropy provided by CAAM's DRBG once. Therefore, prediction resistance was turned off and
 *    the reseeding interval was increased to INT32_MAX - 1 requests which is below the maximum allowed 2^48 requests
 *    without reseeding according to NIST SP 800-90A. If reseeding is still triggered, it will fail and the AWDG is 
 *    disabled.
 *    For a genuine application we expect that the AWDG_ValidateTicket() call which fetches random data from the 
 *    DRBG is called at max in 10s interval. Hence, the AWDG could operate ~680 years (beyond the lifetime of the device) 
 *    before it would be disabled.

 * This function sets up the internal watchdog unit (timeout, grace period),

 * Further, the initial nonce is initialized to a fresh random value,
 * so that an attacker can not determine it.
 *
 * When starting the AWDG the defined timeout ticks (either initial or saved) are
 * increased by one as documented by the internally used LWDGU_KickOne() function.

 * before calling this function. AWDG_MBEDTLS_HEAP_MIN_STATIC_BUFFER_SIZE defines

 * If wasRunning is true, the savedTicksToTimeout value is used for
 * restoring the previous watchdog state. Note that the restoring assumes that
 * the tick frequency stayed the same, else the resumed state is not consistent
 * with the previous one! The caller of this function has to save the watchdog's
 * current ticksToTimeout value manually, if he wants to make use of the restoring
 * functionality. He can retrieve this value using the AWDG_GetRemainingTicks()
 * function.

 * agents might use or modify the awdg_t object) and mutually exclusive
 * to all other API functions!
