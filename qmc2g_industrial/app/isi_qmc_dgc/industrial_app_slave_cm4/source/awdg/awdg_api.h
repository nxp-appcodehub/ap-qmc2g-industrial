 * @brief Defines the authenticated watchdog timer (AWDG).
 *
 * The authenticated watchdog timer is an extension for the LWDGU module. An authenticated
 * watchdog only allows the deferral if a fresh + valid signed ticket is provided.
 *
 * This module relies on the mbedtls library and requires at least AWDG_MBEDTLS_HEAP_MIN_STATIC_BUFFER_SIZE
 * bytes of memory. The user has to setup mbedtls to have at least this amount of heap
 * memory available!
 *
 * The AWDG has to be initialized dynamically with the AWDG_Init() function which also
 * starts the watchdog. A nonce for ticket creation can be obtained by calling the
 * AWDG_GetNonce() function. A signed ticket can be given to and verified by the AWDG
 * using the AWDG_ValidateTicket() function (takes up to 15016ms on a RT1176 CM4).
 * After a successful verification attempt, the user can defer the watchdog by executing
 * the AWDG_DeferWatchdog() function.
 *
 * The AWDG_Tick() and AWDG_GetRemainingTicks() functions can be called from interrupts,
 * other functions should not be called from interrupts.
 * Check the API descriptions of the individual functions for detailed information
 * about the concurrency assumptions.
 *
 * The ticket signature algorithm is fixed to ECDSA with a 512 bit curve, the
 * signature and key have to be in the ASN.1 DER format defined in www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf
 * Appendix C. The ticket is a binary blob with the following content:
 *  | new timeout (u32 LE) | ASN.1 DER 512 bit ECDSA signature |
 *   0                    3 4                               140 (max)
 *
 * The external requirements for the QMC2G project are:
 *  - The AWDG should be ticked every millisecond. This allows timeout periods
 *    up to (2^32 - 2) / 1000 / 3600 / 24 ~ 49 days.
 *  - After the AWDG expires the system has to be notified about the upcoming reset (logging)
 *    and the reset cause  has to be stored in the SNVS storage. The reset cause should not
 *    be reset during booting by the CM4 (as the CM7 application needs the contents).
 *  - The AWDG's counter value and state (running / not running) should be stored in a
 *    shadow register for the SNVS storage after each AWDG tick in the timer interrupt.
 *    The backup counter value is calculated by right shifting the current tick value by 16
 *    (+ rounding up; value approximately represents minutes). If the AWDG has not expired the
 *    backup state value matches the AWDG's isRunning flag, otherwise it is set to 0.
 *    If the AWDG did expire the state value of 0 is directly written into the SNVS
 *    storage, similar as the reset cause, to ensure the values are backed up before
 *    the system reset.
 *    The shadow register is periodically written back to the SNVS storage in the main loop.
 *    These backup values are used during initialization to restore the watchdog's state (if it was running).
 *    For the initialization the 16-bit shifted counter value is decremented by 1.
 *    The two possible saved states before an initialization are: Timer was not running at all (fresh init)
 *    and timer was running (resume with values from SNVS).
 *    The SNVS values are reset to zero at a cold boot, hence the values in the SNVS storage
 *    should be designed so that an initial value of zero is logically correct
 *    (e.g. a running flag is ok).
 *  - The before mentioned SNVS storage has to be isolated from the CM7 after the initial
 *    bootloader handed over control and must be only accessible by the CM4 afterwards.
 *  - If the AWDG should expire during the grace period of a functional watchdog unit,
 *    the reset cause shall be overwritten to reflect that the AWDG expired. This
 *    behaviour is relevant for security as the reset cause is used to trigger an
 *    boot of the recovery image. However, in the worst case this means that the log entry describing
 *    that the AWDG expired will not make it into the log file.
 *    Further, in the case a functional watchdog unit expires during the grace period of the AWDG
 *    the reset cause should not be overwritten by the functional watchdog unit!
 *  - If the AWDG initialization fails the caller has to ensure that the board reboots
 *    into recovery mode.
 *  - The QMC project needs possible timeout times of >= 7 days, this should be asserted wherever
 *    the AWDG is configured. Can not be done in this module as it would influence testability.

 * This function sets up the internal watchdog unit (timeout, grace period),
 * initializes the RNG with the given seed, loads + parses the public key needed
 * for the signature verification and starts the authenticated watchdog timer.
 * Further, the initial nonce is initialized to a fresh random value,
 * so that an attacker can not determine it.
 *
 * When starting the AWDG the defined timeout ticks (either initial or saved) are
 * increased by one as documented by the internally used LWDGU_KickOne() function.
 *
 * Note that setting up a heap allocator for mbedtls must be done by the user
 * before calling this function. AWDG_MBEDTLS_HEAP_MIN_STATIC_BUFFER_SIZE defines
 * the minimum necessary heap memory.

 * If wasRunning is true, the savedTicksToTimeout value is used for
 * restoring the previous watchdog state. Note that the restoring assumes that
 * the tick frequency stayed the same, else the resumed state is not consistent
 * with the previous one! The caller of this function has to save the watchdog's
 * current ticksToTimeout value manually, if he wants to make use of the restoring
 * functionality. He can retrieve this value using the AWDG_GetRemainingTicks()
 * function.

 * agents might use or modify the awdg_t object) and mutually exclusive
