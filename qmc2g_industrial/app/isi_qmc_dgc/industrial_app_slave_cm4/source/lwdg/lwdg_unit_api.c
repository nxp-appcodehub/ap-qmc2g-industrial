 * @brief Contains the LWDGU implementation for creating and managing a group of logical watchdogs.
 *
 * # 1 Introduction
 * This document describes the design of the logical watchdog module. The
 * logical watchdog module allows to instantiate and manage a group of virtual
 * watchdogs in software on top of an existing timer source. We call a managed
 * group of virtual watchdogs a logical watchdog unit (LWDGU).
 * It supports the static creation and allocation of logical watchdogs to units
 * (groups). The timeout ticks of the watchdogs are individually programmable,
 * the timeout time in seconds depends on the call interval of the associated
 * tick function. Each watchdog unit has a dedicated grace watchdog which
 * will be started if any watchdog of the group expires. The grace watchdog
 * is configured the same way as the other watchdogs and therefore the grace
 * period is programmable. After the grace watchdog expires the user shall
 * reset the system. The watchdog unit will stay in the expired state until a
 * reset has happened.
 * Calling the tick function of the watchdog unit, notifying other parts about
 * the upcoming system reset and resetting the system is part of the user's responsibility.
 * Further, the user has to ensure that only one of the provided functions
 * accesses a LWDGU unit at any given time (correct locking).
 * See Section 3 for details about the expected module context.
 * This library only provides an hardware-independent overlay to implement
 * logical watchdogs.
 * By using static memory allocations and sticking to C standard APIs,
 * the module can easily integrated into constrained environments. Note that no
 * locking was performed internally as the available locking mechanisms and their
 * side-effects highly depend on the used architecture and environment. Section 2
 * provides more insight into the design principles of this module.
 * Section 4 provides insight into the timing behaviour of the module.
 *
 * # 2 Design Principles
 * ## No internal dynamic memory allocations
 * The logical watchdog module does not depend on the availability of
 * any dynamic memory allocator. Therefore, it can easily be integrated
 * in constraint environments like microcontrollers without an operating
 * system.
 * ## No internal MT and interrupt safety (no internal locking)
 * The public callable functions are designed without considering any kind of
 * concurrent execution. This limitation was accepted as available locking
 * mechanisms and their side-effects do depend on the actual architecture and
 * environment the code is running on. For example, in case of a x64 Linux setup
 * a pthread_mutex lock can be used. On the other hand, on a single processor
 * bare metal environment disabling interrupts is sufficient (assuming some of the
 * functions are called in an interrupt).
 * Locking shall always be performed if two different execution contexts
 * (two threads, different interrupts, one interrupt and the main code, ...)
 * access the same LWDG unit concurrently.
 * However, note that all pointer arguments to the underlying structures are 
 * volatile which allows the underlying structures to be a global variables 
 * accessed by external agents if proper locking is applied.
 *
 * # 3 Expected Module Context
 * The logical watchdog module needs the support of external code and
 * components to achieve its functionality and typical additional tasks:
 * ## Timer Source
 * The LWDGU_Tick function needs to be called by a configured and
 * running timer. How this timer is configured and started is not scope of
 * this module. The user has to make sure that it works right and that
 * the LWDGU_Tick function is indeed called with the right period.
 * ## System Reset Notification
 * If LWDGU_Tick returns kStatus_LWDG_TickJustStarted, the grace watchdog
 * has been started and the system will be reset soon. It is left to the
 * user to take the appropriate actions to notify other parts of the system
 * of the pending reset so that they can prepare for it.
 * ## System Reset
 * If LWDGU_Tick returns kStatus_LWDG_TickJustExpired the user has
 * to ensure that a system reset happens. Otherwise, the logical watchdog
 * module will just stay in the expired state and can not be reset.
 * It is emphasized once again that the module is designed to have no
 * knowledge about the internals of the system and the user has to add
 * platform-specific functionalities.
 *
 * # 4 Timing Behaviour
 * The accuracy of a watchdog's timeout time depends on the tick frequency.
 * For example, suppose we have a watchdog with a tick frequency of 1kHz
 * (1ms interval) and a wanted timeout of 5ms (timeout ticks == 5).
 * Then, the following behaviour occurs (see also the description of LWDG_Init function
 * for more information):
 *
 *      |   K   |       |       |       |       |       |
 *              T       T       T       T       T       T
 *          ^                                        expires !
 * The last kick before an expiration can happen anywhere in the corresponding
 * tick interval (which is then counted as served)!
 * The max. time deviation caused by this behaviour is +1 tick interval.
 *
 * Note that for the internal conversion between timout times and timeout ticks
 * the results are rounded up to the next possible value (whole integers)
 * which can cause an additional deviation of max. +1 tick interval.
 *
 * So the expected accuracy (not considering any deviations of the used clock
 * or side-effects from locking) of the timeout times is:
 *      min: choosen timeout time   max: choosen timeout time + 2 * 1 / choosen tick frequency
