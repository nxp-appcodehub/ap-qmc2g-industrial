/*!
 * @file main_cm4.c
 * @brief Main entry file of the QMC2G M4 core code.
 *
 * To debug / run together with the M7 software and without SBL follow these steps:
 *
 *  1) Compile the CM4 project with the "NO_SBL" define set
 *      - This will use a static RNG and PK as replacement for the data received from the SBL
 *          - !!! only for testing / debugging, do not set this define for production use !!!
 *  2) Start debugging M7 and run until the instruction after BOARD_InitBootPeripherals() in main()
 *  3) Start debugging M4 and let it run
 *  4) Continue M7 core
 *
 *  Note that for debugging / testing purposes the AWDG timeout is set to 24 hours, if the sum of your
 *  debugging times exceeds this timeout without the AWDG being kicked then the system is reboot once.
 *  This timeout and other CM4 implementation specific options can be changed in the file "qmc_cm4_features.h".
