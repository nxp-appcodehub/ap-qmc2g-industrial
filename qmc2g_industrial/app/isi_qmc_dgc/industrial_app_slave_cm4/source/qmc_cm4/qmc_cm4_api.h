 * @file qmc_cm4_api.h
 * @brief Implements the CM4 board API.
 *
 * The CM4 board API acts as glue logic between the HAL and the higher-level API functions.
 *
 * Main tasks of the CM4 board API are:
 *  - Configuring the CM4 software and hardware parts
 *  - Managing the functional watchdogs (configuration, ticking, kicking, reset notification, reset)
 *      - See "qmc_cm4_features_config.h" header file for configuration.
 *  - Managing the authenticated watchdog (configuration, ticking, kicking, reset notification, reset)
 *      - See "qmc_cm4_features_config.h" header file for configuration.
 *  - Setting the user outputs (GPIO13), notifying CM7 about user input (GPIO13) changes
 *      - See "qmc_cm4_features_config.h" for initial output value
 *  - Setting and getting the current time (SRTC)
 *  - Writing the firmware update status and the reset cause to the battery-backed SNVS LP register
 *  - Backing up the authenticated watchdog state to the battery-backed SNVS LP register
 *  - Performing system resets
 *
 * Since it is assumed that any access to the SNVS domain is too slow to run in ISRs, the
 * required SNVS content is mirrored within this module. There are two mirrors of all required SNVS fields.
 * In the main processing loop the mirrors are checked for differences.
 * If the mirrors are different, the changed items are synchronized with the SNVS hardware registers.
 * NOTE: The state backup of the secure watchdog timer is still written to hardware in an ISR out of security
 * reasons (attacker should not be able to extend timeout by blocking synchronization).
 *
 * The following code does not use interrupt nesting and correct functionality does depend on this
 * precondition! The maximum time spend in a interrupt (without invocations that lead to a reset) is 210us,
 * hence we can guarantee that the interrupt ticking the watchdogs works as expected (only the hardware watchdog
 * expiry interrupt has a higher priority, but that is excluded as it is executed only if the program can not be
 * trusted anymore).
 * Interrupt invocations which led to a reset were excluded, because even if the ISR processing would have been
 * faster just the reset would have happened faster, in both cases (future) pending ISRs are not executed.
 * For the timeout backup of the AWDG this is also not critical as it is anyhow halved at each reboot.
 * In the worst case ticking might happen around 210us later as expected, but that can be neglected
 * in comparison to the wanted timeout intervals.
 *
 * For reentrancy and concurrency assumptions, check the individual API descriptions.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *  - The backed-up RTC offset needs two SNVS LPGPR registers, hence a power-loss / reset inbetween
 *    the writing of these two registers may lead to a corrupted RTC offset. Furthermore, this may lead
 *    to unexpected time values.
