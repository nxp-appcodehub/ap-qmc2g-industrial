 * @file qmc_cm4_api.h
 * @brief Implements the CM4 board API.
 *
 * The CM4 board API acts as glue logic between the HAL and the higher-level API functions.
 *
 * Main tasks of the CM4 board API are:
 *  - Configuring the CM4 software and hardware parts
 *  - Managing the functional watchdogs (configuration, ticking, kicking, reset notification, reset)
 *      - See @ref qmc_cm4_features_config.h header file for configuration.
 *  - Managing the authenticated watchdog (configuration, ticking, kicking, reset notification, reset)
 *      - See @ref qmc_cm4_features_config.h header file for configuration.
 *  - Setting the user outputs (GPIO13), notifying CM7 about user input (GPIO13) changes
 *      - See @ref qmc_cm4_features_config.h for initial output value
 *  - Setting and getting the current time (SRTC)
 *  - Writing and reading the firmware update status and the reset cause to and from the battery-backed SNVS LP register
 *  - Performing system resets
 *  - Storing the system state in the SNVS
 *      - State of AWDG
 *      - Firmware update state
 *      - Real-time clock offset (SRTC)
 *      - Reset cause
 *
 * Since it is assumed that any access to the SNVS domain is slow, the required SNVS content is mirrored within this
 * module. There are two mirrors of all required SNVS fields. There are two mirrors of all required SNVS fields.
 * In the main processing loop the mirrors are checked for differences.
 * If the mirrors are different, the changed items are synchronized with the SNVS hardware registers.
 * NOTE: The state backup of the secure watchdog timer is still written to hardware in an ISR out of security
 * reasons (attacker should not be able to extend timeout by blocking synchronization).
 *
 * The following code does not use interrupt nesting and correct functionality does depend on this
 * precondition! The maximum time spend in a interrupt (without invocations that lead to a reset) is 210us.
 * Hence, we can guarantee that the interrupt ticking the watchdogs works as expected (only the hardware watchdog
 * expiry interrupt has a higher priority, but that is excluded as it is executed only if the program can not be
 * trusted anymore).
 * Interrupt invocations which led to a reset were excluded, because even if the ISR processing would have been
 * faster, just the reset would have happened faster. In any case (future) pending ISRs are not executed.
 * For the timeout backup of the AWDG this is also not critical as it is anyhow halved at each reboot.
 * In the worst case ticking might happen around 210us later as expected, but that can be neglected
 * in comparison to the wanted timeout intervals (multiple hours).
 *
 * Note that the system should have a charged coin cell inserted, otherwise the secure watchdog will always indicate
 * an expiry so that the cyber resiliency feature is not bypassed.
 *
 * For reentrancy and concurrency assumptions, check the individual API descriptions.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *  - The RTC offset needs two SNVS LPGPR registers, hence a power-loss / reset between
 *    the writing of these two registers may lead to a corrupted RTC offset. Furthermore, this may lead
 *    to unexpected time values.

 * This function should be called from the SNVS_HP_NON_TZ_IRQHandler interrupt.
 * Ticks the functional and authenticated watchdog, notifies the system about
 * an upcoming reset in case of a watchdog expiration, writes the system state
 * to the SNVS and finally resets the system.
 * 
 * For ensuring that the authenticated watchdog is ticked and that the tick 
 * frequency matches the expectation the HW watchdog WDOG1 is used. Note
 * that this enforcement still allows to prolong timeouts insignificantly 
 * as we have to keep a buffer for other interrupts that may happen exactly
 * before this one and processing time noise. The maximal increase in percent
 * of authenticated watchdog timeout times this enforcement allows can be 
 * calculated as:
 * 
 * \f$\Delta = \frac{\mathrm{QMC\_CM4\_WDG\_TICK\_FREQUENCY\_HZ} \cdot (\mathrm{HAL\_WDG\_TIMEOUT\_VALUE} + 1 - \mathrm{HAL\_WDG\_INT\_BEFORE\_TIMEOUT\_VALUE}) \cdot 0.5}{\mathrm{QMC\_CM4\_TICKS\_UNTIL\_HWDG\_KICK\_RELOAD}} - 1\f$
